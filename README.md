Quick Start Guide:

This repository contains the analysis code to generate the morphometric parameters for the simulated and experimental actin networks. The analysis code is implemented in MATLAB and ImageJ.
We have also included folders with the actin positions and image files of sample simulated actin networks to allow users to see how the morphometric parameters are extracted.

To use the code:
1. Download the folder named simulated_actin_positions.zip
2. Run the ImageJ Macro on the simulated actin images
